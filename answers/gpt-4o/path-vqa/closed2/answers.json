These terms refer to changes in the kidney tissue, where interstitial fibrosis is the formation of fibrous tissue in the interstitial space and tubular atrophy is the shrinking or degeneration of the kidney tubules. Atypical dysplastic cells replacing the entire epithelial thickness would indicate severe epithelial dysplasia, which is a different condition."
